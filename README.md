# MINIAPPLES

Miniapples is a collection of very wide ranging interesting/useful open source mini-applets (games, utilities, applications) that are too small to justify their own project.

I present them as a collection of zip files, each containing source code, executable and text file description.

Click on the txt file to read the description, click on the zip to download.

## CASCADE

To  move, type the letter (a-z) you wish to remove and the balls will cascade
down the gaps left. On reaching the bottom they will add to your score. 
The computer tries to do the same, and the game ends when there are no balls left.
A simple game, but its a neat concept.

## RACER

Steer your car along the road, using the 4
and 6 keys on the keypad, or the cursor left/right keys. Hit the
CTRL key to Accelerate - when released, you drop back again.
Try to avoid on coming CARS, MINES (white), and OIL slicks, but
try to collect yellow GOLD BARS for points. When you hit an
on-coming car, mine, or run off the road, the game is over - when
you hit OIL, you skid. Try to collect green BONUS ARROWS, for
points, and a fast 'GOLD-RUN', but avoid red POISON PILLS, which
narrow the road and give you a fast 'MINE-RUN'!
During the GOLD-RUN, you do not have to face other cars, or mines.
You can select a different speed by hitting the F1 key on the title
screen.
