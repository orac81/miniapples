# miniapples
Miniapples is a collection of very wide ranging interesting/useful open source mini-applets (games, utilities, applications) that are too small to justify their own project.

I present them as a collection of zip files, each containing source code, executable and text file description.

Click on the txt file to read the description, click on the zip to download.

## CASCADE

To  move, type the letter (a-z) you wish to remove and the balls will cascade
down the gaps left. On reaching the bottom they will add to your score. 
The computer tries to do the same, and the game ends when there are no balls left.
A simple game, but its a neat concept.
