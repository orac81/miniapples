# MINIAPPLES

Miniapples is a collection of very wide ranging interesting/useful open source mini-applets (games, utilities, applications) that are too small to justify their own project.

I present them as a collection of zip files, each containing source code, executable and text file description.

## CASCADE (1982)

<img src="https://github.com/orac81/miniapples/blob/main/pc-cascade-screen.png">

The PET version of CASCADE was first published in CCI Nov 1982 magazine.

When playing, to  move, type the letter (a-z) you wish to remove and the balls will cascade
down the gaps left. On reaching the bottom they will add to your score. 
The computer tries to do the same, and the game ends when there are no balls left.
A simple game, but its a neat concept.

## RACER (1982)

Steer your car along the road, using the 4
and 6 keys on the keypad, or the cursor left/right keys. Hit the
CTRL key to Accelerate - when released, you drop back again.
Try to avoid on coming CARS, MINES (white), and OIL slicks, but
try to collect yellow GOLD BARS for points. When you hit an
on-coming car, mine, or run off the road, the game is over - when
you hit OIL, you skid. Try to collect green BONUS ARROWS, for
points, and a fast 'GOLD-RUN', but avoid red POISON PILLS, which
narrow the road and give you a fast 'MINE-RUN'!
During the GOLD-RUN, you do not have to face other cars, or mines.
You can select a different speed by hitting the F1 key on the title
screen.

## SDL-CONNEX

<img src ="https://github.com/orac81/miniapples/blob/main/sconnex155screenshot.png">

SCONNEX is a version of the famous 4-in-a-line game, written to work on almost any computer. It can compile to work as an SDL app (screen shot above) or as a C99 terminal program. The compiled executable is only 10-20k, yet it can search 20+ moves ahead in a few seconds on modern PCs.
It uses the classic recursive AlphaBeta search algorithm, and is a useful example of its use. The board size can be changed from 4x4 upto 12x12, there is an edit voard function to setup positions, and a two player mode to use the program for human games. 
For more program details see file  "sconnex.txt".

CONNEX is a version of the well known "4-in-a-line" game (Connect-4),
for any Commodore computer (C64, C16, PET, VIC, etc).
The game is quite simple. Two players (White and Black) takes turns 
to drop a piece down a column on a 7x6 board. The first player that makes 
4 in a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins. 

The "connex-zen-vic5k.prg" VIC20 version of CONNEX was first published in 
Personal Computer World Magazine, Jan 1983.
