     PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
    ----------------------
  
   Like all the best strategy games, CASCADE is easy to learn and
 yet tough to actually master. On playing the game you are presented
 with a maze of letters, scattered with balls and other objects.
 Each player (you v Computer) takes turns to remove a letter, and
 the balls cascade down the gaps left. On reaching the bottom, they
 will enter your hopper and add a value to your score. This value is
 normally 1, but is changed if a ball hits a NEGATOR or DOUBLER in
 its travels. NEGATORS and DOUBLERS act as TOGGLES - ie. hitting a
 DOUBLER once turns the mode on, hit it again and its switched off.
 Hitting a BONUS is normally worth 4 points, although this becomes
 -4 points if NEGATE mode is on, or double that if DOUBLE mode is on.
 If you hit a flask of GELIGNITE you will clear a path adjacent to
 that square. When you hit a REGENERATOR, part of the maze is
 regenerated, and some extra balls are dropped in at the top.
 
  Notes/Hints: Since point scores can be negative, each player
starts with 100 points. The LOWEST balls in the maze are dropped
first - remember this when trying to hit targets. When a ball has
an equal choice of two routes down (left or right), a random choice
is made.

  To make moves during play, simply select the letter you want to
remove by typing LOWERCASE a..z, or move the mouse to the letter and
click the left button. Other Commands:

  F1 - Highlight letter - show positions of selected letter.
  F2 - Computer takes your go.  
  F3 - Auto play - Hit ESC to end.
  F4 - Change IQ level.
  F5 - Toggle Two-player mode on/off. 
  F6 - Enter EDIT MODE - Move cursor & type a..z, 0..9, F1..F4 keys
       to place objects in maze. Hit RETURN to get back to game.
  F7 - Load a maze off disk.
  F8 - Save current maze to disk.

I hope you enjoy playing CASCADE!

   Technical notes and compiling for modern PCs
  ----------------------------------------------

  CASCADE is a classic strategy game for MSDOS from the 1990s. 
It can run on nearly any classic PC, from XT/8086/CGA up to Pentiums with 
VGA graphics. It uses some simple VGA hardware assisted scrolling effects.
The code shows some of the hardware tricks and hacks programmers from this 
era used.

For most users on modern PCs, I very strongly suggest using an emulator 
like DOSBOX for MSDOS programs like this, it is much "safer" than running 
under MSDOS directly.
The program isnt very demanding in terms of processor speed.

You will find C the source code supplied in the zip archive,
to compile you will need Turbo C 2.0 (or 3.0.)
It was released by Borland as a free download. 
(Try the links at the end of the Turbo-C wikipedia page)

A batch file TCMAKE.BAT is included, under MSDOS (or DOSBOX) compile with:

tcmake d:\progs\tc2 cascade -ms -Z

Obviously change the correct path "d:\progs\tc2" for Turbo C for your PC.
Commands for paths for LIB and INC might need adding for TC3 or other Borland
compilers. 
Its should be possible to adapt the code for Microsoft C, Watcom C, 
Pacific C, or recent GNU 16 bit compiler conversions, although some work
will probably need doing on Turbo-C syntax for things like BIOS calls, etc.

CASCADE is a re-write of a PET program of mine, which was published in 
Commodore Computing International in Nov 1982.
