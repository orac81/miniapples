  CASCADE
 ---------
   
CASCADE is a BASIC game for any 40 column CBM computer. (C64, C16, PETs..)

"cascade2bas.prg"      - Basic version for any cbm, load with ",8" not ",8,1" 
                         (its is located at $0401 so PETs can load it.)
"cascade2c64.prg"      - Compiled c64 version.
"cascade2c16.prg"      - c16/+4 version. (Basic)
"cascade11v20.prg"     - Vic20 version (unexpanded)

To  move, type the letter (a-z) you wish to remove and the balls will cascade
down the gaps left. on reaching the bottom they will add to your score. 
The computer trys to do the same. The game ends when there are no balls left.
A simple game, but its a neat concept.

The PET version of CASCADE was first published in CCI Nov 1982 magazine.
